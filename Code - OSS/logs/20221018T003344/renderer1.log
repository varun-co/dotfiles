[2022-10-18 01:15:45.821] [renderer1] [warning] [File Watcher (parcel)] started ignoring events due to too many file change events at once (incoming: 7686, most recent change: /home/varun/Desktop/pinaca/tamilTranscriptions/ctcdecode/third_party/boost_1_67_0). Use 'files.watcherExclude' setting to exclude folders with lots of changing files (e.g. compilation output).
